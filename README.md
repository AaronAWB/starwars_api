## Summary

This project was a great exercise in working with React and a REST API - swapi.dev. API calls are made using the Axios HTTP client. Building this app gave me an opportunity to learn about API calls, including promises, using responses, error handling, and working with JSON formatted data.

The user can scroll through nine table "pages" displaying the name, birth date, height, mass, homeworld, and species of each of the 82 characters for which swapi.dev maintains data. Alternatively, the user can search for characters by name using the search bar.
